## Deploy your Amplify sandbox backend

Return to the sandbox link you kept handy from earlier. It should look something like the following.

```
https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/deploy/<UUID>
```

### Log in or create a new AWS account

If you don’t have an AWS account, you will need to create one first:
1. Select **Create an AWS account**
2. Once you have an account, select **Login to deploy to AWS**
3. When logged in, you will be taken to the Amplify Console

### Create app backend
On the creation form:
<!-- // spell-checker: disable-next-line -->
1. Give your app a name. We went with **amplifiedtodo**
2. Select your preferred deployment region
3. Click **Confirm deployment**

4. The on screen text should walk you through the deployment progress and, when the deployment status reads **Deployment completed**, click **Open admin UI**.

    ```

## Verifying cloud sync

### Inspect data

From the Amplify Admin UI, select **Content** from the sidebar. If you have added todos from your app, you should see them show up as part of the results!

![Inspect items](/images/lib/getting-started/reactnative/add-api-verify-sync-inspect-items.png)

### Create data

Synchronization is bi-directional. Try creating a Todo entry from the Content screen in the Admin UI:
1. Click **Create todo**

    ![Content](/images/lib/getting-started/reactnative/add-api-verify-sync-create-todo.png)

2. Fill in the form
  - **name**: Sync app to cloud
  - **description**: This was created remotely!
  - **isComplete**: false (unchecked)
3. Click **Save Todo** on the form to save the new entry

    ![Content](/images/lib/getting-started/reactnative/add-api-verify-sync-save-todo.png)

You should see your app update with a newly created todo in real-time!
